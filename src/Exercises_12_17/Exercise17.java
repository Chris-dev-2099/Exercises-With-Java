/* 17. Write a program that takes a HashMap where the keys are names of
students and the values are lists of grades, and calculate the grade point average
for each student.*/

        ratings.put("Juan", List.of(10, 8, 9));
        ratings.put("Mar√≠a", List.of(9, 7, 10));
        ratings.put("Pedro", List.of(8, 9, 8));
